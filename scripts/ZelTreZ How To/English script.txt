Title: Full Node Warnings

-Full node wallet requires a complete copy of the coin blockchain and proving keys (if required)
-Blockchains can be large (BTC is >200GB) and can fill up your HDD quickly
-Downloading blockchains and proving keys can take a long time (hours+)
-ZelTreZ encrypts the wallet files for full node. The swing wallet will no longer function properly after launching Full Node in ZelTreZ (a backup is automatically created to revert back to swing wallet if necessary)
-Lightweight (default) mode is recommended for 99% of users. Those that require full node capability should know how to use full node wallets already
